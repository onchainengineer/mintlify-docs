title: 'How It Works'
description: 'Creating a workstation for your AI agent is as simple as defining what it needs.'
---

```hcl
# Define a workstation for a sales agent
resource "workstation" "sales_agent" {
  name     = "sales-automation"
  image    = "windows-base"    # Windows environment
  
  resources {
    cpu    = 2
    memory = "4GB"
  }

  applications = [
    "crm",      # Sales CRM access
    "browser",  # Web access
    "office"    # Document handling
  ]

  security {
    isolation = "strict"
    monitoring = "enabled"
  }
}
```

Your AI agent can then work safely in its own environment:

```python
from your_agent import SalesAgent

# Your AI agent logic
def automate_sales():
    update_leads()
    send_follow_ups()
    update_crm()

# Safely execute in isolated workstation
agent = SalesAgent(workstation="sales-automation")
agent.run(automate_sales)
```
