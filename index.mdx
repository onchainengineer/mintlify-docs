    Traditional environment setup can take days or weeks. wirtual.dev reduces this to minutes with pre-configured environments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hardware Costs" icon="money-bill">
    Physical hardware for development and testing is expensive. Wirtual environments provide a cost-effective alternative.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Limited Testing Capabilities" icon="vial">
    Testing edge cases and failures on physical hardware is risky and limited. Wirtual environments enable comprehensive testing.
