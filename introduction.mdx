# Welcome to wirtual.dev

wirtual.dev is a platform designed to accelerate physical AI development by providing instant-deploy simulation environments. Our platform enables developers and companies to train and test AI agents in virtual environments before deploying them to real-world robots, autonomous vehicles, and other physical systems.

## What is wirtual.dev?

wirtual.dev simplifies the complex process of setting up and managing simulation environments for physical AI development. Instead of spending days or weeks configuring simulation environments, you can deploy a fully configured environment in under 5 minutes.

### Key Features

* **Instant Environment Deployment**: Go from signup to running your first physical AI simulation in minutes

* **Pre-built Templates**: Access templates for common robotics and autonomous system scenarios

* **NVIDIA Isaac Sim Integration**: Seamless integration with industry-standard simulation tools

* **Real-time Collaboration**: Built-in tools for team development and resource sharing

* **Multi-Cloud Support**: Deploy across various cloud providers or use local infrastructure

## Why wirtual.dev?

Traditional physical AI development faces several challenges:

* Complex environment setup and configuration

* High costs of physical hardware during development

* Limited ability to test edge cases and failures

* Difficulties in scaling development across teams

wirtual.dev addresses these challenges by providing:

* Pre-configured simulation environments

* Cost-effective virtual testing

* Comprehensive scenario testing capabilities

* Team-oriented development tools

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install CLI

```bash
curl -L https://wirtual.dev/install.sh | sh
```

### Step 2: Authenticate

```bash
wirtual login
```

### Step 3: Create Environment

```bash
wirtual create my-first-sim --template basic-robot
```

## Core Components

### Environment Templates

Templates are the foundation of wirtual.dev. They provide:

* Pre-configured simulation settings

* Hardware specifications

* Sensor configurations

* Testing scenarios

### Workspaces

Workspaces are your active development environments, offering:

* Instant deployment

* Resource monitoring

* Team collaboration

* Version control

### Development Tools

Integrate with your existing workflow using:

* SSH access

* VSCode integration

* Port forwarding

* Git integration
