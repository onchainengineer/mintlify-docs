# Workstations for AI Agents

The personal computer revolution gave every human the power to run software. Now, as AI agents become increasingly capable, they need their own workstations to operate in. Wirtual gives every AI agent its own secure workstation, enabling the next wave of AI automation.

<Callout type="warning">
Don't run AI agents on your local machine. Every AI agent deserves its own secure, isolated workstation.
</Callout>

## Why AI Needs Workstations

Today's AI agents can write code, analyze data, and handle complex tasks. But they're missing something crucial: their own workstations to operate in. Currently, developers must choose between:
- Limiting their agents to APIs (restricted functionality)
- Using unstable browser automation (unreliable)
- Running on local machines (dangerous)

Wirtual solves this by giving each AI agent its own secure workstation where it can safely operate real software.

## How It Works

Creating a workstation for your AI agent is straightforward:

```hcl
# Define a workstation for a sales agent
resource "workstation" "sales_agent" {
  name     = "sales-automation"
  image    = "windows-base"    # Windows environment
  
  resources {
    cpu    = 2
    memory = "4GB"
  }

  applications = [
    "crm",      # Sales CRM access
    "browser",  # Web access
    "office"    # Document handling
  ]

  security {
    isolation = "strict"
    monitoring = "enabled"
  }
}
```

Your AI agent can then work safely in its dedicated environment:

```python
from your_agent import SalesAgent

# Your AI agent logic
def automate_sales():
    update_leads()
    send_follow_ups()
    update_crm()

# Safely execute in isolated workstation
agent = SalesAgent(workstation="sales-automation")
agent.run(automate_sales)
```

## Real-World Applications

### Sales Automation
Your AI sales assistant gets its own workstation to:
- Find and research prospects
- Update CRM records
- Send follow-up emails
- Schedule meetings

### Market Research
Give your research agent a dedicated workstation to:
- Browse news sites
- Create summary reports
- Update dashboards
- Track competitors

### Healthcare Administration
Your admin agent gets a secure workspace to:
- Process insurance forms
- Manage patient records
- Update ERP systems
- Schedule appointments

## Secure by Design

Every Wirtual workstation provides:

```hcl
# Security built into every workstation
security {
  isolation    = "strict"     # Complete process isolation
  networking   = "controlled" # Restricted network access
  monitoring   = "full"       # Comprehensive activity logs
  compliance   = "enabled"    # Audit trail for all actions
}
```

## Resource Smart

Workstations automatically manage their resources:

```hcl
# Efficient resource management
resources {
  scaling {
    min_instances = 1
    max_instances = 10
    auto_scale    = true
  }
  
  limits {
    cpu_max    = 4
    memory_max = "8GB"
  }
}
```

## Your Tools, Your Way

Manage AI workstations with your preferred tools:
- VS Code
- JetBrains IDEs
- Vim/Emacs
- Access via HTTPS or SSH

## Core Concepts

Understanding Wirtual means understanding a few key ideas:

1. **Every Agent Gets Its Own Workstation**: Just as humans need their own workspace, AI agents need their own secure workstations.

2. **Complete Safety**: Each workstation is isolated, protecting both the agent and your systems.

3. **Real Software Support**: Agents can use any Windows or Linux software directly.

4. **Smart Resource Use**: Workstations manage their own resources efficiently.
