# Workstations for AI Agents

Just as personal computers gave humans the power to interact with software, Wirtual gives AI agents their own secure workstations to operate in. We're enabling the next billion AI agents by giving each one its own personal computer.

  Don't run AI agents on your local machine. Every AI agent deserves its own secure, isolated workstation.

## The Missing Piece for AI

Today's AI agents are becoming remarkably capable - they can write code, analyze data, and handle complex tasks. But they're missing something crucial: their own computers to work on. Currently, developers must choose between limiting their agents to APIs, risking unstable browser automation, or endangering their local machines.

Wirtual solves this by giving each AI agent its own secure workstation where it can safely operate real software, just like humans do with their PCs.
